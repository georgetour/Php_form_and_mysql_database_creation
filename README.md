# php_form_and_mysql_database_creation
Mysql database creation with php and a form .We create the database ,then the table ,the form the user will see ,the submitted form 
for the server and we can show all registers in a page.

Since we use a server we need a tool like XAMPP or similar or real server to test it.

Note :this is just for demontration purposes for a project I had and doesn't contain passwords for security.
Always password your databases and make security your top priority.
